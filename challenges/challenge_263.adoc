== 5x5 Crypto
:ch_category: Cryptography
:ch_flag: CTF{THUMBS_UP}

=== Input

> Ever heard of the 5x5 secret message system? If not, basically it's a 5x5 grid with all letters of the alphabet in order, without k because c is represented to make the k sound only. Google it if you need to. A letter is identified by Row-Column. All values are in caps. Try: 1-3,4-4,2-1,{,4-4,2-3,4-5,3-2,1-2,4-3,_,4-5,3-5,}

=== Resolution

1. Create the table as described and match the coordinates from the input (as y-x indices starting at 1 in the top left corner).

,===
A,B,C,D,E
F,G,H,I,J
L,M,N,O,P
Q,R,S,T,U
V,W,X,Y,Z
,===

```python
table = [l.split(',') for l in """A,B,C,D,E
F,G,H,I,J
L,M,N,O,P
Q,R,S,T,U
V,W,X,Y,Z""".split('\n')]
rule = "1-3,4-4,2-1,{,4-4,2-3,4-5,3-2,1-2,4-3,_,4-5,3-5,}"
print(''.join([(table[int(r.split('-')[0])-1][int(r.split('-')[1])-1] if len(r) > 1 else r[0]) for r in rule.split(',')]))
```

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
