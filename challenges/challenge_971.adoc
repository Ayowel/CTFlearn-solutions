=== Input

> The flag is hidden in the jpeg file. Good Luck! Have some Pho! Solve this challenge before solving my Scope challenge for 100 points.

=== Resolution

1. Running `exiftool -a -u` on the image shows a warning `[minor] Unknown APP3 'Samsung' segment`, indicating unknown/unsupported segments that might contain the flag
2. Adding the `-v3` option or opening the file directly in a text editor reveals the flag hidden in the first 150 bytes

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
