:ch_category: Web
:ch_flag: ctf{watch_0ut_f0r_th3_m0ng00s3}

=== Input

> Here! http://web.ctflearn.com/web7/ I forget how we were doing those calculations, but something tells me it was pretty insecure.

=== Resolution

// This one is a bit weird and "unnatural", probably because it was
// built to allow a single command for the ctf instead of exposing
// a fault that could be used to solve said ctf
// Multi-word values are not supported, neither are many other
// combinations, which either yield the provided input or nothing at all

1. Try to calculate a value and notice that the calculated value is sent to the backend and part of the output sent back
2. Try to send custom injection values for `expression`. Trying a simple bash injection (`;ls`) shows a file with the flag as its name

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
