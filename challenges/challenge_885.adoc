== Modern Gaius Julius Caesar
:ch_category: Cryptography
:ch_flag: CTFlearn{Cyb3r_Cae54r]

=== Input

> One of the easiest and earliest known ciphers but with XXI century twist! Nobody uses Alphabet nowadays right? Why should you when you have your keyboard?
>
> BUH'tdy,|Bim5y~Bdt76yQ

=== Resolution

1. Reading the input, guess that we're supposed to use a Caesar cipher with the keyboard's keys as alphabet (assuming a US qwerty alphabet by default)
2. Reading the cipher, assume that there is a differentiation between lowercase and uppercase letters
3. Knowing that the cleartext should end with `}` and should start with `flag{` or `ctflearn{`, try to guess the real offset

```python
# BUH is a line-based offset of 2 with CTF on the keyboard, which also works if lines are wrapped around
c = "BUH'tdy,|Bim5y~Bdt76yQ"
line_offset = -2
lowercase_lines = [
    "`1234567890-=",
    "qwertyuiop[]\\",
    "asdfghjkl;'",
    "zxcvbnm,.?",
]
uppercase_lines = [
    "~!@#$%^&*()_+",
    "QWERTYUIOP{}|",
    "ASDFGHJKL:\"",
    "ZXCVBNM<>?",
]
all_lines = lowercase_lines + uppercase_lines
# Search for the character in each line. If it is in the current line, remap at the offset
print(''.join([[l[(l.find(i)+line_offset)%len(l)] for l in all_lines if i in l][0] for i in c]))
```

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
