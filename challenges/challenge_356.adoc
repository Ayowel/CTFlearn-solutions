== A CAPture of a Flag
:ch_category: Forensics
:ch_flag: flag{AFlagInPCAP}

=== Input

> This isn't what I had in mind, when I asked someone to capture a flag... can you help? You should check out WireShark. https://mega.nz/#!3WhAWKwR!1T9cw2srN2CeOQWeuCm0ZVXgwk-E2v-TrPsZ4HUQ_f4

=== Resolution

1. Download the wireshark capture from the link provided in the input (hereafter `flag.pdump`)
2. Open the file in Wireshark (or in tshark with `tshark -r 'flag.pdump' --color`)
3. Notice the insecure (HTTP) requests to a POST HTTP API, and notice that one of the GET requests (nÂ°247) contains a base-64 encoded `msg`
4. Base64-decode the `msg` value

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
