== POST Practice
:ch_category: Web
:ch_flag: flag{p0st_d4t4_4ll_d4y}

=== Input

> This website requires authentication, via POST. However, it seems as if someone has defaced our site. Maybe there is still some way to authenticate? http://165.227.106.113/post.php

=== Resolution

1. Inspect the page's content to notice a comment that contains the `admin` user's password (`71urlkufpsdnlkadsf`)
2. Send a request to the page with POST content as it would be formatted in a GET query: `curl -d 'username=admin&password=71urlkufpsdnlkadsf' http://165.227.106.113/post.php`

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
