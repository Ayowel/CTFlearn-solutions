=== Input

=== Resolution

1. Extract the image's content with `binwalk --dd '.*' AGT.png`
2. Unzip one of the non-empty archives extracted by binwalk to reveal the file `Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../I Warned You.jpeg`
3. Search the flag in the file with `strings "I Warned You.jpeg | grep -i ctf`

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
