=== Input

> I found an interesting game made by some guy named "John_123". It is some betting game. I made some small fixes to the game; see if you can still pwn this and steal $1000000 from me!
>
> To get flag, pwn the server at: `nc thekidofarcrania.com 10001`


=== Resolution

1. Connect to the target server with netcat
2. When prompted for the desired sum, set it to a high negative value (ex: `-1000000000`)
3. Lose the game by providing an impossible value 10 times

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
