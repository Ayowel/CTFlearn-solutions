=== Input

> These numbers were scratched out on a prison wall. Can you help me decode them? https://mega.nz/#!al8iDSYB!s5olEDK5zZmYdx1LZU8s4CmYqnynvU_aOUvdQojJPJQ

=== Resolution

* Open the file in the provided link
* Notice the that the file's values are variables used for an RSA encryption: the exponent `e`, the primes product `n` and the cyphertext `c`
* Notice that, as the exponent is 1, the "cyphertext" is also the cleartext (as the formula is `c = (m^e) % n` with m the cleartext)
* Decrypt the flag by mapping the "cyphertext" `c` to its cleartext value

```python
# Calculation in python, assuming c is previously initialized
# Note that we are manipulating big numbers here, which may cause issues if you try
# to re-implement this in a language without being carefull of the sizes of the values it supports
''.join([chr(c//(256**i)%256) for i in range(30, -1, -1)])
```

=== Solution

`{ch_flag}`
